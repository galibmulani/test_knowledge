# In this repo we perform basic practice for git #
## steps by step operation: ##
- git init (initialize the git to your local repo/ project folder)
- git add **<file_name>** (any kind of file can be appended)
- git commit -m "Your meaning/track the commit operation"
- git push origin **<branch_name>** (to see update on github profile we use this command to push)

# Question araise when inter team of company works on single branch the structure becomes missey# 
## To avoid this we can create many branches as company require to work specific team ##

# Merge : #
## why do we require merge operation?##
### Lets say a developer from one team is work on feature and another team developer also works on same project now developer1 and developer2 both features needed see integert  outcome they merge there code with a each other ###

## compare and pull request
[example]
- feature1 (frontend developer) 
- feature2 (frontend developer)  
- master (PM monitor the developed feature's)  
## If both feature1 and feature2 are different written on same line of code now manager has to pick one feature of them like button or nav link ##
